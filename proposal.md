# Proposal

## The Gist:
I'm intent on creating some screensavers. I've always enjoyed working with visuals in processing, and I think that this is a good way to try my hand at some more advanced animation-related stuff. The hope is that I convert them into .exe, then into .scr (screen saver format on windows) in order to actually run one on my home computer. Doing some research and inspiration-gathering on the Beautiful Processing website is a good start to the project.

## Must Have:
* At least 2 different screensavers - I'm thinking of doing a mesh "worm"-like program that swims across the screen for one of them.
* All screensavers have to involve movement of some kind across the screen - the basic purpose of a screensaver is to ensure all pixels in the monitor recieve some activity while asleep.

## Nice To Have:
* A converted .scr file that can be executed on my home PC.
